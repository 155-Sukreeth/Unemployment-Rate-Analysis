# Unemployment-Rate-Analysis
This is a personal Exploratory Data Analysis project using the dataset from kaggle which include data collected over the years 1991-2021.
I have analyzed the rate of unemployement for various countries during 5 significant employement affecting periods:

1) The Dot-com bubble (1997-2001) - The rapid growth of the internet and technology industries led to a surge in employment in these sectors, but also resulted in a burst of the dot-com bubble and widespread layoffs in the early 2000s.

2) 9/11 Terrorist Attacks (2001) - The attacks on September 11, 2001, had a profound impact on the global economy and employment, causing widespread job losses in the travel, tourism, and hospitality sectors.

3) Global Financial Crisis (2008) - The 2008 global financial crisis led to widespread job losses, particularly in the finance, real estate, and construction sectors.

4) The rise of automation and artificial intelligence (2010s) - The rapid development of automation and AI technologies has led to increased efficiency and productivity, but also to job displacement in some industries.

5) COVID-19 Pandemic (2019-2021) - The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on the global economy and employment, leading to widespread job losses in many sectors, particularly in hospitality, travel, and retail.

and lastly I have performed analysis on the top 6 most countries contributing to the GDP
